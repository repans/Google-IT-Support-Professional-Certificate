### 01.  You're doing desktop support, and the company policy is that you can only help with company equipment. A user walks in:

Tech: Hi there, how can I help you?

User: My computer is really slow, and I can barely use it. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?

Tech: It looks like this is a personal computer. Are you talking about your work computer?

User: Uh, no, this is the one that I need help with. I figured you’re good with computers, and you could help. My daughter needs it for a school assignment that’s due tomorrow, but it's too slow for her to get anything done.

What would you do?
   
- [ ] Tell them you can’t help them and suggest they go to a local tech store for help.   
- [x] Explain why you can’t troubleshoot the issue, per the company policy. But give them some tips on what common issues could be slowing down his computer, and how they might go about fixing them.   
- [ ] Forget about the policy and help them!    
- [ ] Politely tell them that it's against the company policy, and you can’t help them.  


### 02.  Situation: You work for a company that requires a visual verification when resetting passwords. The verification doesn't have to be done through your company account. However, you must see the person "live" (not through a picture), so that you can match them to their photo before resetting their account.

Scenario: Phone call

Anastasia: Thanks for calling. My name is Anastasia. How can I help you?

Ling: Hi, Anastasia. This is Ling. I need to reset my account password.

Anastasia: Hi, Ling. I’d be happy to help you with that, but first I need to verify your identity. Can you do a video call with me through Skype?

Ling: I can’t get into my work account. That's why I’m calling.

What would you do in this situation? Check all that apply.
   
- [x] Ask the user if they have a personal account to use for Skype.   
- [x] Offer to set up a video call through Skype, Facetime, or Hangouts.   
- [ ] Kindly tell them they will have to wait until the next day to meet with someone live.   
- [x] Suggest the user make a video call with you through their phone.  


### 03.  A user needs their password reset. The IT Support Specialist is pulling up the necessary information while the user starts asking a bunch of questions: Why does the password have to have a capital and a symbol? Why can’t I write it down? Why does it change so often? Isn’t this a waste of time?

How would you respond to the user?
   
- [ ] Ignore the user and keep working on resetting the password, so you don’t lose your place.   
- [x] Let the user know that you're working on their issue and will be sure to answer all of their questions once you're done.   
- [ ] Kindly ask the user to stop asking questions, since you're trying to solve their problem.   
- [ ] Stop what you're doing and explain to the user that passwords should have numbers and symbols for security purposes, and this is more important than productivity.   


### 04.  You receive the following ticket from a user: 

My machine is saying I have to reboot, but this is silly. I have a ton of processes running, I don’t want to have to reload everything. This is a waste of time. I’ve included a screenshot of the message. Please advise.

- [ ] When installing programs, you need to reboot your machine.   

- [x] Thanks for contacting support. I see that you’re concerned about rebooting your machine.   
  Based on the screenshot you provided, it looks like you received the reboot prompt because a new program was installed. In order for the program to start working, you’ll need to reboot your machine. Is it possible to save your commands beforehand, so that you can get to them again?      
  Please let me know if there is anything further that I can help you with.

  Regards,

- [ ] I see that you’re concerned about rebooting your machine.
  I looked into the screenshot you provided, and it appears the reboot is due to a new program you installed. In order for the program to run, a reboot has to be done.
  It was a pleasure working with you.

- [ ] Hi Aditya,
  Thanks for contacting support.

  Mia: Hi Yuki, how are you today? I see that you are concerned about needing more bandwidth. I’d be happy to help.

  Yuki: Thanks, I really need it!

  Mia: Can I ask what you mean by “needing more bandwidth?”

  Yuki: I mean that everytime I try to use my computer after lunch, it’s incredibly slow. I think I’m using all the bandwidth in the morning.


What do you do next?
