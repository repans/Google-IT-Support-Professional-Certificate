### **Question 1:** What are some weaknesses of the WEP scheme? Select all that apply.

- [x] Its use of the RC4 stream cipher 
- [x] its poor key generation methods 
- [ ] Its use of ASCII characters for passphrases 
- [x] its small IV pool size
> The RC4 stream cipher had a number of design flaws and weaknesses. WEP also used a small IV value, causing frequent IV reuse. Lastly, the way that the encryption keys were generated was insecure.



### **Question 2:** What symmetric encryption algorithm does WPA2 use?

- [x] AES
- [ ] DES
- [ ] RSA
- [ ] DSA
> WPA2 uses CCMP. This utilizes AES in counter mode, which turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.



### **Question 3:** How can you reduce the likelihood of WPS brute-force attacks? Check all that apply.

- [x] Disable WPS.
- [ ] Update firewall rules.
- [ ] Use a very long and complex passphrase.
- [x] Implement lockout periods for incorrect attempts.

### **Question 4:** Select the most secure WiFi security configuration from below: (just one)

- [ ] WPA personal
- [ ] WPA2 personal
- [ ] WPA enterprise
- [ ] None
- [x] WPA2 enterprise
> WPA2 Enterprise would offer the highest level of security for a WiFi network. It offers the best encryption options for protecting data from eavesdropping third parties, and does not suffer from the manageability or authentication issues that WPA2 Personal has with a shared key mechanism. WPA2 Enterprise used with TLS certificates for authentication is one of the best solutions available.  


### **Question 5:** What process authenticates clients to a network?

- [ ] a. wpa2
- [ ] b. TKIP
- [x] c. Four-way handshake
- [ ] d. HMAC-SHAL
> WPA2 Enterprise would offer the highest level of security for a WiFi network. It offers the best encryption options for protecting data from eavesdropping third parties, and does not suffer from the manageability or authentication issues that WPA2 Personal has with a shared key mechanism. WPA2 Enterprise used with TLS certificates for authentication is one of the best solutions available.
