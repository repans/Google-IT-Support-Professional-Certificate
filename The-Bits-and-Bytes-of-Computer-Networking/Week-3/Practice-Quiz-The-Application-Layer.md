### 01.  Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.   
    
- [x]  The presentation layer    
- [ ]  The interconnection layer    
- [ ]  The compression layer    
- [x]  The session layer  

> The presentation layer might handle things like compression or encryption.
> The session layer handles delivery of data from the transport layer to applications themselves.


### 02.  An example of something that operates at the application layer is: 
    
- [ ]  TCP    
- [x]  A web browser     
- [ ]  UDP    
- [ ]  A router  

> Web browsers and server operate at the application layer.


### 03.  What's the standard number for a TTL field?
    
- [ ]  8    
- [ ]  16    
- [ ]  32    
- [x]  64   

> While this value can be set to anything from 0 to 255, 64 is the recommended standard.


### 04.  Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?
    
- [x]  Networking stack    
- [ ]  ARP message    
- [ ]  The source port    
- [ ]  The router  

> The networking stack is the part of the operating system responsible for handling networking functions.


### 05.  Which section of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contains the data the application wants to send?
    
- [ ]  The header of the Ethernet frame    
- [ ]  The payload section of the Ethernet frame    
- [ ]  The payload section of the IP Datagram    
- [x]  The payload of the TCP segment   

> The payload of the TCP segments has a generic data section which contains the data that is sent.
