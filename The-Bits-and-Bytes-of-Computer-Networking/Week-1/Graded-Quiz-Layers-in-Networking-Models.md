### 01. 
Let's test your knowledge of the five-layer networking model presented in this course.

This quiz consists of 2 parts:

1. The first part will test your knowledge of the Networking layers. To do this, drag a layer from the “Available Items” column and drop it in the correct order in the “Network Layers” column. Check your answers. If you make a mistake, click the “Reset” button to try again.

2. In the second part, match samples of the layers to each Networking layer. To do this, choose an item from the “Available Items” column and match it with the correct layer in the “Network Layers” column. Check your answers. If you make a mistake, click the “Reset” button to try again.

Quiz consideration:

1. To complete the quiz, you will need to get 100% accuracy on both parts. You can check your answers before submitting.  You can continue to part 2 after you have completed part 1 with 100% accuracy.

2. If you choose to try the quiz again, make sure to click the “Try Again” button before continuing. If not, the plugin will allow you to practice the quiz, but will not allow you to submit your grade.

3. When you’re done, make sure you have closed the fullscreen quiz and click the “Submit Quiz” button to earn a grade.

Good luck!
