### 01. Routing Paths and Subnets  
We are going to test how much you’ve learned about routing paths and subnetting.   

In this activity, you are going to have 8 pairs of source and destination IP addresses. Your task is to route each of these packets from the correct source network to the correct destination network.   

You will mimic how the packets travel from the source IP address to the destination IP address within the network. For this, you will need to use your knowledge of IP addresses, subnetting masks, network ID, Subnet ID, and CIRD.    

1. You will be presented with a pair of source and destination IP addresses as shown in the table below.   

  | Source        | Destination  | 
  | ------------- | ------------ |  
  | 192.168.1.181 | 10.1.254.254 | 

2. In this example, our source IP is: 192.168.1.81. Using our knowledge of Subnetting, we know that it is in the subnet 192.168.1.64/26. Our destination IP is 10.1.0.0/16. Using the same principals as with the source IP, we know that it is in subnet 10.1.0.0./16.

Click the clouds in the correct order from the network source to the destination network, following the flow diagram.

3. After you’ve selected the source and destination networks, click the “Check” button. Some of these address pairs may not be represented by the networks available. If that’s the case, click the “Source or destination not present” button.

If you click the “Source or destination not present” button, the check button will not be activated. However, the button will turn green if you are correct. If the button turns red, it means that both addresses are in the exercise. 

If you make a mistake, click the “Reset” button to try again.

 4. Once you have correctly answered a question, move on to the next question by clicking on the next question arrow. There are 8 different questions.

5. After you’ve completed all routing paths listed in the table, close the quiz and click the “Submit Quiz” button for a grade.

Good luck! 


#### Quiz consideration:

1. To complete the quiz and have a grade, you will need to get 100% accuracy.
1. If you choose to try the quiz again, make sure to click the “Try Again” button before continuing. If not, the plugin will allow you to practice the quiz, but will not allow you to submit your grade.
1. When you’re done, make sure you have closed the fullscreen quiz and click the “Submit Quiz” button to earn a grade.

Good luck!
