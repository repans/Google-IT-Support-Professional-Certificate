### 01.  Which of the following are types of Interior Gateway Protocols? (Select all that apply)
    
- [x]  Link State Routing Protocols    
- [x]  Distance-Vector Protocols.    
- [ ]  Hypertext Transfer Protocol    
- [ ]  Transmission Control Protocol


### 02.  Who is permitted to use non-routable address space?
    
- [ ]  It's for testing purposes only    
- [x]  Anyone    
- [ ]  The IANA    
- [ ]  The IETF


### 03.  A typical routing table may contain which of the following? Check all that apply.
    
- [ ]  TTL    
- [ ]  Destination address    
- [x]  Total Hops    
- [x]  Destination Network  



### 04.  What is the difference between Interior Gateway Protocols and Exterior Gateway Protocols?
    
- [x]  Interior Gateway Protocols share information within a single autonomous system. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between multiple autonomous systems.    
- [ ]  There is no difference between them.    
- [ ]  Interior gateway protocols share information with multiple autonomous systems. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between independent autonomous systems.    
- [ ]  Interior gateway protocols share information with public networks. Exterior gateway protocols are used for private networks.   
> Interior gateway protocols are used on organization networks. Exterior gateway protocols are used to share information across different organizations.  


### 05.  Which of the following are non-routable IP addresses? (Select all that apply)
    
- [ ]  9.0.0.0    
- [x]  172.16.0.0/12    
- [x]  192.168.0.0/16.    
- [x]  10.0.0.0/8  
> RFC 1918 defined three ranges of IP addresses that belong to no one, so anyone can use them. The primary three ranges of non-routable address space are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These ranges are free for anyone to use for their internal networks.
