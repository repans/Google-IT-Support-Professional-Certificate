### 01.  What is two-factor authentication? Select all that apply.
       
- [x]  a method where you authenticate twice       
- [ ]  a method where you need two passwords       
- [x]  a method where users are required to verify their credentials through a combination of hardware and/or software. Usually a username, password, and a short-lived token.            
- [ ]  a method that requires two usernames

> Two-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity and level of access through a combination of hardware (biometric scanners, key fobs, etc.) and/or software (software tokens, passwords, etc.). 



### 02.  VPNs are known as a _____ protocol.
       
- [ ]  network layer       
- [ ]  data link layer       
- [ ]  Connectionless       
- [x]  Tunneling   

> VPNs are tunneling protocols.


### 03.  A proxy is something that _______________________.
       
- [x]  communicates on behalf of something else       
- [ ]  allows for many devices to speak to one other device       
- [ ]  encrypts traffic sent across the Internet       
- [ ]  sends data across a single network segment

> While proxies are many things, they primarily communicate on behalf of something else.


### 04.  What are some use cases for reverse proxies? Select all that apply.
       
- [x]  Load balancing       
- [x]  Encryption and Decryption     
- [ ]  Improved computer graphics       
- [ ]  IP address translation 

> Reverse proxies can distribute incoming requests to multiple physical servers, acting as a load balancing mechanism.    
> Reverse proxies can be implemented in order to use hardware built specifically for cryptography, to perform the encryption and decryption work.    


### 05.  What was one of the first technologies that commonly utilized 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)?
       
- [ ]  TCP       
- [ ]  DNS       
- [x]  VPN       
- [ ]  UDP   

> VPN was one of the first technologies to commonly use two-factor authentication.
