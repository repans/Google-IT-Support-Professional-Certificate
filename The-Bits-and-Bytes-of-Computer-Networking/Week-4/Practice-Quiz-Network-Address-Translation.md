### 01.  What technique allows for specific destination ports to be configured to always deliver to specific nodes?
       
- [ ]  IP masquerading       
- [ ]  Ephemeral ports       
- [x]  Port forwarding       
- [ ]  IP translation    

> Port forwarding is a technique that allows for inbound traffic through a router configured to NAT.


### 02.  The total number of IPv4 addresses is approximately: 
       
- [ ]  4.2 million       
- [ ]  100 billion       
- [x]  *B: 4.2 billion       
- [ ]  4.2 trillion

> There are approximately 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses.


### 03.  Which Regional Internet Registry(RIR) serves the USA and Canada? 
       
- [ ]  RIPE       
- [x]  ARIN       
- [ ]  APNIC        
- [ ]  LACNIC    

> ARIN serves the USA and Canada.


### 04.  What is another solution to IP exhaustion that will create more public IP addresses as it is implemented?
       
- [x]  IPv6       
- [ ]  IP masquerading       
- [ ]  RFC1918       
- [ ]  Port preservation   

> IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses and can provide a nearly infinite number of addresses.


### 05.  What allows a gateway to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing datagram? 
       
- [ ]  IANA       
- [ ]  IPv6       
- [ ]  IPv4       
- [x]  NAT   

> Network address translation (NAT) allows a gateway to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing datagram.
