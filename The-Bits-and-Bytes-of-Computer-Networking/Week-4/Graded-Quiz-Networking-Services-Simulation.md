Let’s test your knowledge of networking services! You’re an IT Support Specialist at a new company. As your company grows, your manager asks you to solve various networking problems. Your task is to select the correct network device or server to solve the manager’s request.

Step 1: Read the manager’s request in the top-left corner of the screen. The manager’s request will be in the blue speech bubble next to the graphic of a person.

Step 2: Drag and drop the correct network device or server icon (e.g. DHCP) into the "drop here" box on the screen. If you make a mistake, click the back arrow button and try again.

Step 3: After you have completed all requests, close the quiz window and click the “Submit Quiz” button.

Good luck!
