### 01.  Which of the following need to be configured for a computer to operate on a modern network? Check all that apply.
       
- [x]  A name server       
- [x]  An IP address       
- [ ]  A TCP port       
- [ ]  A MAC address     

> All computers need an IP address, the subnet mask for the local network, a primary gateway, and a name server configured to operate on a modern computer network.


### 02.  When using Fixed Allocation DHCP, what is used to determine a computer's IP?
       
- [X]  A MAC address
- [ ]  Location       
- [ ]  An A Record       
- [ ]  A subnet mask    

> Fixed Allocation DHCP ensures that computers receive an IP address reserved for it via its MAC address.    


### 03.  The process by which a client, configured to use DHCP, attempts to get network configuration information is known as _________________.
       
- [ ]  DHCP Request       
- [ ]  DHCP Acknowledgement       
- [X]  DHCP Discovery       
- [ ]  DHCP Offer    

> DHCP Discovery is how a client determines configuration information.


### 04.  Which of the following are ways a DHCP can operate? Select all that applies.
       
- [ ]  CIDR       
- [ ]  ARP       
- [X]  Fixed allocation       
- [X]  Dynamic allocation   

> Fixed allocation requires a manually specified list of MAC addresses and their corresponding IPs.
> DHCP dynamic allocation is the most common way that a DHCP server operates. A range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one.


### 05.  DHCP is a protocol of which layer?
       
- [ ]  Transport layer       
- [ ]  Network Layer       
- [X]  Application layer       
- [ ]  Physical layer   

> DHCP is an application layer protocol.
