### 01.  An IPv6 address is how many bits long?
       
- [x]  128       
- [ ]  32       
- [ ]  64       
- [ ]  16    

> An IPv6 address is 128 bits long


### 02.  What is the very first field in an IPv6 header?
       
- [ ]  source address field       
- [ ]  data payload field       
- [x]  version field       
- [ ]  traffic class field    

> This field is used to indicate what version of IP is being used.


### 03.  Which IPv6 header field indicates how many routers can forward a packet before it's discarded?
       
- [ ]  router forward field       
- [ ]  TTL       
- [ ]  next header field       
- [x]  hop limit field    

> The hop limit field configures how many routers can try to forward a packet before it's discarded.


### 04.  The IPv4 mapped address space within IPv6 always starts with _______ zeroes.   
       
- [ ]  32       
- [x]  80       
- [ ]  64       
- [ ]  "128" 

> 80 zeroes, followed by 16 ones, followed by the IPv4 address itself.


### 05.  For IPv6 traffic to travel on an IPv4 network, which two technologies are used? Select all that apply.   
       
- [ ]  IPv4 Tunnels       
- [ ]  Packets       
- [x]  Datagrams      
- [x]  IPv6 tunnels    

> IPv6 tunnel servers take incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4 datagrams.
> An IPv6 tunnel is used to encapsulate data between IPv6 tunnel servers.
